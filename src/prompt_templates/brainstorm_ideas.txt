Task: Propose PPA optimization strategies for this RTL design.

RTL Code: ${rtl}
Current PPA: ${ppa_report}
Goals: ${project_goals}
Human Context: ${resolved_ticket_answers}

Process:
1. Analyze the RTL code using your built-in context management
2. Review previous optimization history from graph: ${historical_context}
3. Identify optimization opportunities
4. Distinguish between what you can implement vs. what requires human clarification

Before requesting help, check:
- Is information discoverable in the code?
- Is this Implementation (you can handle) or Intent (need human)?
- Is the potential value significant enough?

Output Format (JSON):
{
  "strategies": [
    "Actionable optimization idea 1",
    "Actionable optimization idea 2",
    ...
  ],
  "help_requests": [
    "Specific question blocking a high-value optimization"
  ]
}

You can include both strategies AND help_requests. Omit keys if empty.
